# Process Util
A library used for parsing running processes on Windows with the "tasklist.exe" utility.

If there isn't a reason you *need* tasklist output specifically, you should probably look into other solutions.

This library was made to serve a niche usecase and not to be used a general library for interacting with the OS.
